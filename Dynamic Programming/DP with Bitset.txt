We have N different numbers, we need to answer how many different number sum we can get from the all the subset of N numbers.

At first , consider A[] is the array of all N number a
And MAX = Summation (A[i]) (1<=i<=N)

Here is the sudo code.

bitset<MAX> dp ;  

dp.set(0);

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	dp |= dp  << a[i];
cout << dp.count() << '\n';
